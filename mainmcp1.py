        Welcome to Catch Meow - The AI Bluff Detection Game!

        **DETAILED GAME FLOW:**
        1. **Lobby Setup**: 3–8 players join a game lobby and wait for all participants.
        
        2. **Round Begins**: Each round starts with a prompt containing questions or statements to respond to.
        
        3. **Voice Recording**: Every player records a 30-second voice answer to the prompt. Here's the key: players can choose to speak truthfully OR bluff (lie convincingly). Strategy matters!
        
        4. **AI Analysis**: Once all answers are submitted, our AI judge analyzes each recording using voice pattern recognition:
           - Each player receives a bluff score from 0–100
           - Score interpretation: 0–30 = appears honest, 30–70 = uncertain/mixed signals, 70–100 = likely bluffing
           - Players also receive 2–3 specific reasons explaining their score (e.g., "voice stress detected," "hesitation patterns," "pace inconsistency")
        
        5. **Results Reveal**: All results are revealed simultaneously to maintain fairness. No one sees scores until everyone's analysis is complete.
        
        6. **Scoring & Leaderboard**: 
           - In "Honesty Mode" (default): Players earn 100 − bluff_score points (so honest players score higher)
           - Leaderboard updates after each round showing cumulative scores
        
        7. **Next Round**: The game continues with new prompts until players decide to end.

        **STRATEGY TIPS**: Sometimes bluffing obviously can be a strategy, sometimes being subtle works better. The AI learns patterns, so vary your approach!

        • AI analyzes your voice for deception (0-100 bluff score)
        • Lower bluff scores = higher points in Honesty Mode

        Welcome to the AI-powered bluff detection game where your voice patterns determine your fate!
        
        **HOW IT WORKS:**
        1. **Join Lobby**: 3–8 players join together
        2. **Get Prompt**: Each round presents questions or statements to respond to  
        3. **Record Response**: Every player records a 30-second voice answer - you can tell the truth or bluff!
        4. **AI Judgment**: Our AI analyzes voice patterns and assigns bluff scores (0-100):
           • 0–30 = Appears honest
           • 30–70 = Uncertain 
           • 70–100 = Likely bluffing
        5. **Get Results**: See your score plus 2-3 reasons why the AI thinks you were honest or bluffing
        6. **Scoring**: In Honesty Mode, you earn 100 − bluff_score points (honest players score higher)
        7. **Leaderboard**: Track performance across multiple rounds
        
        **THE STRATEGY**: Will you play it safe and be honest, or risk it all with a convincing bluff? The AI is always listening...
